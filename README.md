# moving_masses

moving_masses is a small JavaScript app that shows planet-like movements around a big static mass (**the sun**).
By clicking in the space, you generate a new planet. 
You can size the planets size by clicking on the **PLUS-button** or **MINUS-button**.
The sliders are changing some of the physics and are mostly used for debugging.

It uses the p5.js library.
